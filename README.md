Blender 4.0 represents a major leap for rendering, creating tools, and more to take your Freedom to Create to new heights. Meet the new Principled BSDF. More energy conserving, more efficient, and more flexible. Beautifully easy. The coat layer is placed on top of all base layers, including the emission layer. This can be used e.g. to simulate emissive textures behind glass like a phone screen. Coat tint and IOR inputs were added, so that it can be used for more than a white clearcoat like a tinted car paint coating.

Sheen uses a new microfiber shading model, sitting on top of all layers. Traditionally, sheen has been used for fuzzy cloth, but now it can also be used for dust on arbitrary materials. The following example demonstrates the improvement AgX makes in handling saturation, an area where Filmic struggles. The image contains three fully metallic, fully saturated spheres lit only by the environment.
